Initially  I read the data files to  get an idea of the whole training data set. 
There were in total 160 variables,however many variables had empty or NA values, and  60 variables (out of 160) had non null values. 
So I first removed the columns/vavriables which had empty rows/NA values and for the trainingg data set only included those variables which did not have any null values/NA values.
I also removed some other fields did'nt seem relevant for prediction (like counter, user name, timestamp etc.). 
At the end I had a data with  53 variables inculding the "classe" variable.


After indentifying the dependent variables following were the steps for prediction:

1. Divided the data into training set & test set(70:30)

2. Named  the 20 cases as "validation set"

3. Made the variable types of training and validation data same (otherwise at the end during prediction was getting error: the predictor type in the new data does not match with training data)

4.Deciding upon the model to be used

Initially I applied linear regression,however
I finally chose the random forest algorithm as it was giving a better accuracy.However

5.Applied cross valiadation with parallel processing before applying the model -This speeds up the processing,other-wise it was taking forever to process and give the output.
I took aid for parallel processing in random forest fromt he below guidelinesfrom one of our mentors:
https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-randomForestPerformance.md 


I got the accuracy for test data se for 5 classes as below:
Accuracy   0.9988 0.9942 0.9858 0.9967 0.9993



6. The last step was prediction for 20 cases, which I got as follows:

[1] B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B 
Levels: A B C D E
