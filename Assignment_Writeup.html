There were in total 160 variables,however many variables had empty or NA values, and  60 variables (out of 160) had non null values. 
So I first removed the columns/vavriables which had empty rows/NA values and for the trainingg data set only included those variables which did not have any null values/NA values.
I also removed some other fields did'nt seem relevant for prediction (like counter, user name, timestamp etc.). 
At the end I had a data with  53 variables inculding the "classe" variable.


After indentifying the dependent variables following were the steps for prediction:

1. Divided the data into training set & test set(70:30)

2. Named  the 20 cases as "validation set"

3. Made the variable types of training and validation data same (otherwise at the end during prediction was getting error: the predictor type in the new data does not match with training data)

4.Deciding upon the model to be used

Initially I applied linear regression,however
I finally chose the random forest algorithm as it was giving a better accuracy.

5.Applied cross valiadation with parallel processing before applying the model -Cross validation ensures that there is no over fitting and parallel processing speeds up the processing,other-wise it was taking forever to process and give the output.
I took aid for parallel processing in random forest from the below guidelines from one of our mentors:
https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-randomForestPerformance.md 


I got the accuracy for test data set for 5 classes as below:
Accuracy   0.9988 0.9942 0.9858 0.9967 0.9993



6. The last step was prediction for 20 cases, which I got as follows:

[1] B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B 
Levels: A B C D E
